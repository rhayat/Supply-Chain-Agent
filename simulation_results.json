If C decreases their bid, their profit decreases (since their profit is $106.0 - $105 = $1). If C bids exactly $119.0 or slightly below, they still win, but their profit increases (e.g., at $119.0, profit is $14). Thus, C could profitably deviate by bidding just below $119.0 (say, $118.99), win the auction, and earn a profit of $13.99.\n- A: If A bids below $106.0, they win, but their cost is $110, so any winning bid below $110 yields negative profit. If A bids between $106.0 and $110.0, they win, but still make negative profit. Any bid above $110.0 but below $119.0 does not win, so profit remains zero. Thus, A cannot profitably deviate.\n- B: B's cost is $120, and their bid is $145.0. If B bids below $106.0, they win but make negative profit. Any bid between $106.0 and $120.0 wins, but profit is negative. Any bid above $120.0 but below $145.0 does not win, so profit is zero. Thus, B cannot profitably deviate."
