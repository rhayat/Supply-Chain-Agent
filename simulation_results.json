If C lowers their bid, they still win but at a lower price, reducing their profit. Thus, $108.0 is the optimal bid for C, given the others' bids.\n- For A: If A lowers their bid below $108.0, they could win, but their cost is $110, so any bid below $110 would result in a loss. If A bids exactly $108.0, they tie with C; assuming ties go to C (as in the result), A does not improve. If A bids $109.0 (between $108.0 and $110.0), they still lose (since C's bid is lower). If A bids $111.0 (just above their cost), they still lose. So, A cannot profitably deviate.\n- For B: B's cost is $120, and their bid is $145.0. To win, B would need to bid below $108.0, but that would be below their cost, resulting in a loss. Any bid above $108.0 does not win. So, B cannot profitably deviate."
